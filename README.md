HTML5 Flightboard
-----------------

A HTML5 & CSS3 flightboard from an airport that is automaticly updated using AJAX, jQuery and JSON.

The live data comes from the [Schiphol Amsterdam Airport](http://www.schiphol.nl)

I used the [HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.	com/) (A rock-solid default for HTML5 awesomeness)

It's been a while since i worked on this (check out the Google code repo [http://code.google.com/p/html5flightboard/](http://code.google.com/p/html5flightboard/) for the history)
